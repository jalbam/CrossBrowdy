<p>
	Audio file cache objects (which are created using the <a href="api/CB_AudioFileCache.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileCache</a> class) allow you to use and reuse the same sound multiple times and simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
	It is important to have in mind that each audio file cache object should only contain the same sound (never different ones), although you should provide different audio formats of that sound so the audio file cache object will be able to calculate and use the best one for the current client automatically.
	The more different formats you can provide, the more chances to support more clients.
</p>

<p>
	As some audio formats and some audio APIs are not supported by some clients, audio file cache objects will detect and manage all automatically so you do not need to worry about it.
</p>

<p>
	Internally, each audio file cache object will normally manage multiple <a href="api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects. An audio file cache object can grow automatically in the case it detects it needs more internal <a href="api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects (for example, if it detects we want to play more sound instances simultaneously than the ones it currently has). It can also reload <a href="api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects automatically in the case they failed internally. During this process, the audio file cache object (<a href="api/CB_AudioFileCache.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileCache</a>) will have a 'LOADING' status again and after that the status will be 'LOADED' if all went well or 'FAILED' otherwise. When the 'LOAD' status is reached, the 'onLoad' event function (if any) will be called again (to prevent this, set the 'onLoad' property of the object to something which is not a function once it gets executed).
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="api/CB_AudioFileCache.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileCache</a> objects use a higher abstraction level than the <a href="api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> but lower than the <a href="api/CB_AudioFileSprites.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileSprites</a> ones.
</p>

<p>
	Note that, most of the times, it is recommended to deal with audio files using always the
	<a href="api/CB_Speaker.html" target="_blank">CB_Speaker</a> static class
	which can contain a
	<a href="api/CB_AudioFileSpritesPool.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileSpritesPool</a> object
	(mainly using the
	<a href="api/CB_Speaker.html#.setAudioFileSpritesPool" target="_blank">CB_Speaker.setAudioFileSpritesPool</a> and
	the <a href="api/CB_Speaker.html#.getAudioFileSpritesPool" target="_blank">CB_Speaker.getAudioFileSpritesPool</a>
	functions).
	The <a href="api/CB_AudioFileSpritesPool.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileSpritesPool</a> class uses audio files cache
	and provides multiple sprites groups management as well as many other advanced methods.
</p>

<p>
	When loading an audio file cache object, it is recommended to do it through a user-driven event (as "onClick", "onTouchStart", etc.) in order to maximize compatibility (as some clients could block sounds otherwise).
	Here is an example loading an audio file cache:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers match-braces rainbow-braces">

	var dataURIs = //Here we could define the data URIs for the audios, in their values (but too long for this example):
	{

<p>
	In the case that the audio file cache object has the "checkManually" option enabled, we need to check each of its internally-used <a href="api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects. We can do that easily by calling the "checkPlayingAll" manually after the audio file cache object has been created. It is recommended to do it through a user-driven event (as "onClick", "onTouchStart", etc.) in order to maximize compatibility (as some clients could block sounds otherwise):
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers match-braces rainbow-braces">

	After the audio file cache object has been loaded successfully (and after calling "checkPlayingAll" successfully, if it was necessary), we can start using the audio file cache object freely:

	One of the most interesting features when managing audio file cache objects with CrossBrowdy is that you can change the audio API of all their internal <a href="api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects on the fly (even when they are currently playing!). This can be done easily:

<p>
	It is interesting to know that the methods above can also accept an array of <a href="api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects as a parameter to only affect those objects instead of all the internal ones.
</p>


<p>
	Some other interesting methods that you might not need:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers match-braces rainbow-braces">
	//Clears the sound instances (created by the 'audioFileCache.play' method) which have been cancelled:
	audioFileCache.clearSoundInstances();
	
	//Tries to purge the audio file cache until it reaches a desired number of CB_AudioFile objects (set in the 'audioFileCache.audioFiles' property), removing and destroying some of the current CB_AudioFile objects. For performance purposes:
	audioFileCache.purge(10); //It tries to go down to ten CB_AudioFile objects.

	//Cleans the 'audioFileCache.audioFiles' array, taking off (destroying and removing) the CB_AudioFile objects which are undefined or null. For performance purposes. Internal usage only recommended:
	audioFileCache.clearAudioFiles();
	
	//Calls the error function which should be set in the 'audioFileCache.onError' property (if any), being "this" the CB_AudioFileCache object itself. Internal usage only recommended:
	audioFileCache.errorFunction("Error message");
	audioFileCache.errorFunction("Error message", true); //Avoids setting the 'audioFileCache.status' property as "FAILED" (the value of 'CB_AudioFileCache.FAILED').
</code></pre>

<p>
	In order to free memory and resources, it is possible to destroy the audio file cache object and its internal <a href="api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers match-braces rainbow-braces">
	//Destroys all the internal CB_AudioFile objects (but not the audio file cache object itself), and frees memory:
	audioFileCache.destroyAll();
	audioFileCache.destroyAll(true); //Also stops sounds.
	
	//Destroys the audio file cache object, including all the internal CB_AudioFile objects, and frees memory (already calls the 'audioFileCache.destroyAll' method internally):
	audioFileCache.destructor();
	audioFileCache.destructor(true); //Also stops sounds.
</code></pre>

<p>
	It is also possible to re-load again an audio file cache object:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript line-numbers match-braces rainbow-braces">
	//Loads the audio file cache again with the data given:
	/*	NOTE:
		It is recommended to do it through a user-driven event (as "onClick", "onTouchStart", etc.) in order to maximize compatibility (as some clients could block sounds otherwise).
		If the 'disableAutoLoad' option is enabled, it is always necessary to call the 'audioFileCache.createAudioFiles' manually.
	*/
	audioFileCache.load(audioFileCacheData); //The object in the parameter has the same format that the one used by the constructor of the CB_AudioFileCache class.
</code></pre>
