<p>
	Audio file sprites objects (which are created using the <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileSprites.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileSprites</a> class) allow you to use and reuse different sprites from the same sound multiple times and simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
	It is important to have in mind that each audio file sprites object should only contain the same sound (never different ones), although you should provide different audio formats of that sound so the audio file sprites object will be able to calculate and use the best one for the current client automatically.
	The more different formats you can provide, the more chances to support more clients.
</p>

<p>
	As some audio formats and some audio APIs are not supported by some clients, audio file sprites objects will detect and manage all automatically so you do not need to worry about it.
</p>

<p>
	Internally, each audio file sprites object will normally manage one audio file cache object (which use the <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileCache.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileCache</a> class) that will typically contain multiple <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects. An audio file cache object can grow automatically (expanding itself) in the case it detects it needs more internal <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects (for example, if it detects we want to play more sound instances simultaneously than the ones it currently has). It can also reload <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects automatically in the case they failed internally. During this process, the audio file sprites object (<a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileSprites.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileSprites</a> object) will have a 'LOADING' status again and after that the status will be 'LOADED' if all went well or 'FAILED' otherwise. When the 'LOAD' status is reached, the 'onLoad' event function (if any) will be called again (to prevent this, set the 'onLoad' property of the object to something which is not a function once it gets executed).
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileSprites.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileSprites</a> class could be considered a wrapper for the <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileCache.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileCache</a> class which has been enhanced to add sprites management features.
</p>

<p>
	The <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileSprites.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileSprites</a> objects use a higher abstraction level than the <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileCache.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileCache</a> but lower than the <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileSpritesPool.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileSpritesPool</a> ones.
</p>

<p>
	Note that, most of the times, it is recommended to deal with audio files using always the
	<a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_Speaker.html" target="_blank">CB_Speaker</a> static class
	which can contain a
	<a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileSpritesPool.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileSpritesPool</a> object
	(mainly using the
	<a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_Speaker.html#.setAudioFileSpritesPool" target="_blank">CB_Speaker.setAudioFileSpritesPool</a> and
	the <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_Speaker.html#.getAudioFileSpritesPool" target="_blank">CB_Speaker.getAudioFileSpritesPool</a>
	functions).
	The <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileSpritesPool.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileSpritesPool</a> class uses audio files cache
	and provides multiple sprites groups management as well as many other advanced methods.
</p>

<p>
	When loading an audio file sprites object, it is recommended to do it through a user-driven event (as "onClick", "onTouchStart", etc.) in order to maximize compatibility (as some clients could block sounds otherwise).
	Here is an example loading an audio file sprites object:
</p>

<p>
	In the case that the audio file sprites object has the "checkManually" option enabled, we need to check each of its internally-used <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects. We can do that easily by calling the "checkPlayingAll" manually after the audio file sprites object has been created. It is recommended to do it through a user-driven event (as "onClick", "onTouchStart", etc.) in order to maximize compatibility (as some clients could block sounds otherwise):
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">

		{
			CB_console("Audio file sprites object checked successfully!");

<p>
	After the audio file sprites object has been loaded successfully (and after calling "checkPlayingAll" successfully, if it was necessary), we can start using the audio file sprites object freely:

	Some more advanced sprites management examples:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
	//Gets a sprite by its ID:
	//NOTE: if not found, the returning object will contain a property named "fake" whose value will be set to true.
	var sprite = audioFileSprites.getSprite("dos"); //Returns an object with 'startAt' and 'stopAt' properties.
	
	//Gets all the sprites:

	//Inserts a sprite, keeping the existing ones. If a sprite ID already existed and it is given again (not recommended), it will be replaced by the new one (but keeping its current sound instances, if any):
	audioFileSprites.insertSprite({ startAt : 123, stopAt: 678 }, "sprite_id");
	
	//Sets the 'startAt' and 'stopAt' properties of a sprite (by its ID):

	//Removes all the sprites:

<p>
	In case we need it, we can also get the internal <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileCache.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileCache</a> object to manage it:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
	//Gets the internal CB_AudioFileCache object:
	var audioFileCache = audioFileSprites.audioFileCache;
	
	//Do things with it...

<p>
	Although the <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileCache.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileCache</a> object (used internally by <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFileSprites.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFileSprites</a> objects) can automatically create new internal <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects or remove them when needed, it is also possible to create new ones or remove current ones manually:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">

	One of the most interesting features when managing audio file sprites objects with CrossBrowdy is that you can change the audio API of all their internal <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects on the fly (even when they are currently playing!). This can be done easily:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">

	Apart from some previous methods seen before, it is also possible to perform other bulk actions that will affect all the internal <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects that the audio file sprites object uses:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">

<p>
	It is interesting to know that the methods above can also accept an array of <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects as a parameter to only affect those objects instead of all the internal ones.
</p>

<p>
	Some other interesting methods that you might not need:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">

	audioFileSprites.clearSoundInstances();

	audioFileSprites.purge(10); //It tries to go down to ten CB_AudioFile objects.

	//Cleans the 'audioFileSprites.audioFileCache.audioFiles' array, taking off (destroying and removing) the CB_AudioFile objects which are undefined or null. For performance purposes. Internal usage only recommended:
	audioFileSprites.clearAudioFiles();
</code></pre>

<p>
	In order to free memory and resources, it is possible to destroy the audio file sprites object and its internal <a href="_html/_doc/api/CB_AudioFile.html" target="_blank">CB_AudioFile</a> objects:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
	//Destroys all the internal CB_AudioFile objects (but neither the audio file cache object nor the audio file sprites object) by calling 'audioFileSprites.audioFileCache.destroyAll' internally, and frees memory:

	//Destroys the audio file sprites object and its audio file cache object, including all the internal CB_AudioFile objects, and frees memory (already calls the 'audioFileSprites.audioFileCache.destroyAll' method internally):

<p>
	It is also possible to re-load again an audio file sprites object:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">
	//Loads the audio file sprites object again with the data given:
	/*	NOTE:
		It is recommended to do it through a user-driven event (as "onClick", "onTouchStart", etc.) in order to maximize compatibility (as some clients could block sounds otherwise).
