   CanvasRenderingContext2D interface.
 - Supported canvas.onload event handler.
 - canvas2png() and saveImage() can now take filename as the second
   argument.

(Bug fixes)

 - There was a possibility that FlashCanvas did not work well when
   several Internet Explorer windows existed on the screen.
 - The proxy script was accidentally used even when images were on the
   same domain as the SWF file, if used with absolute URL.
 - FlashCanvas froze if the fillStyle was set to null.
 - Complicated thick lines were sometimes rendered incorrectly.
 - measureText() threw an exception when the argument was numerical.
 - The proxy script should check that the request comes from the same
   host.

(Bug fixes)

 - Backported the arcTo() code from FlashCanvas Pro.
 - restore() didn't restore the clipping region correctly.

   background.
